## 📘 Overview
**QuiSum** is a smart Chrome extension that transforms your reading experience by instantly turning any selected text into:
- 🪄 a **concise AI-generated summary**, or  
- 🧩 an **interactive multiple-choice quiz**,  
- 💬 or even a **chat-based learning session** powered by Chrome’s built-in AI.

It helps students, researchers, and curious minds **learn actively** instead of passively consuming content — all *within the same tab*.

## 🎯 Quick Pitch
> “What if you could summarize, quiz, or chat with any paragraph using just one click?”

That’s **QuiSum** — a minimal, orange-themed, AI-powered Chrome extension that:
- Extracts meaning using Chrome’s **Summarizer API**
- Generates quiz questions using **Prompt API**
- Opens a **chat mode** for deeper learning  
- Adds a **floating AI button** right next to your selected text 🟠  
- Dims your screen automatically during quizzes for laser-focus 🌑  
- And works perfectly via **right-click → “Summarize / Quizify”**
